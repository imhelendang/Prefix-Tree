# Team project for Data Structur/Algorithm class

We are given a collection of strings w₁, w₂, ..., wₖ whose combined total length is n. Then, design an O(n) - time algorithm that determines whether any of these strings are prefixes of one another. 
Afterwards, we ought to argue that out algorithm is correct and meets this runtime bound.
